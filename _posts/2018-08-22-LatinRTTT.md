This month I co-taught an awesome Carpentry Insturctor Training Workshop for 25 Spanish-speaking trainees in 6 ocuntires in Latin America. One thing that made this workshop so special for me is that it has been 3+ years in the making. So, I thought I would tell the story, from my perspective, about all the things that came into play to make this workshop a reality. 

### The early days of Spanish Carpentry workshops

In 2016, Greg Wilson introduced to Selene Fernandez-Valverde to discuss a Software Carpentry meets Spanish-speaking bioinformatics endeavor. Back then my Spanish was 8 years out of practice, and I was still learning to program.  I didn't think I had the expertise to teach programming in Spanish. Sue McClathcy had more expertise and practice, but its still difficult for a native English speaker to live translate a lesson from English to Spanish while live coding in from of a classroom. This observation led to two simultaneous efforts to 1) support a community-wide effort for collaborative lesson translation, and 2) provide instructor training for Spanish speaking instructors.  

### Spanish translations hacakathon and lesson mantainance 

In November 2017, I went to Germany to attend OpenCon and worked on translating Software Carpentry lessons into Spanish with Paula Andrea Martinez. Our hackathon session has been immortalized in the [promotional materials for OpenCon2018](https://twitter.com/open_con/status/1006509708436561921). 

In December 2017, I finished my PhD, and I decided to go visit all the awesome open-science advidace that I met at OpenCon in Buenos Aires. I met Juli Aranco from Buenos Aires and we organized a one [lesson translation hackathon](https://github.com/Carpentries-ES/R-hackaton-es/blob/master/README.md) where we made huge progresson on the Git and R lessons. We also ran a one-day [Software Carpentry Workshop using those translated lessons](https://twitter.com/cantoflor_87/status/983071102523101185). It was a huge success. The translate UNIX lesson was flawless. The Git lesson ran long but was good. Everyone brought snacks to share. All attendeess and 4 of the 5 instructors were female. It was a great day. 

The relase of 3 stable Spanish translations meant that we needed lesson maintainers. So, while living in Buenos Aires, I also co-taught Carpentry Maintainer training in Spanish! I couldn't have done this without Erin Becker, Ivan Gonzalez, and Fran√ßois Michonneau. Living in Argenina gave the the confidence to speak in Spanish about programming. I also emmersedd my self in the maintainer rols and my Git and GitHub skill level skyrocketed. I can pretty much do all things Git now. 

### Instructor training workshops for Spanish instructors

Back in March 2017, Sue and I traveled to Puerto Rico to instructor training in English that coincided with a [Data Carpentry Replicathon](https://twitter.com/raynamharris/status/845273652480425984) (hackathon for replicating scientific results). We conducted the course in English, but we chatting in Spanish over coffee breaks and at parties. It was very cool. We hosted a few virtual bilingual demos and discussions after the workshop and that was fun but lost momentum. 

The real momemtum for me for instructor training came from being introduced to the [R Ladies Buenos Aires](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-buenos-aires/) community in February 2018. One of my co-instructors for the pilot Spanish Carpentry workshop, Paola Prieto, invited me to [give a talk](https://twitter.com/raynamharris/status/978814275497193472) at their group meeting, so I decided to talk The Carpentries and reproducible research with R in Spanish! Everyone was really enthusatic, so I started working to incorporate them into the instructor training program. 

In June 2018, Sue taught a workshop at Jackson lab with about 20 people, but I Zoomed in with two RLadies from Argentina, Laura Acion and Maria Florencia. They did their practicing teaching using [R Gapminder Spanish lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder-es/). I'm proud to say that Laura and Maria have already completed their instructor training, and the 3 of us are continuing to work together via RLadies Buenos Aires and the [LatinR conference](http://latin-r.com/cronograma/#session-25)!

Finally, in August 2018 we make it to the thing that people have been waiting for, a [fully distributed online instructor training](https://twitter.com/raynamharris/status/1030828857929224192) with participants in Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Educador, Mexico and Peru [1]. This was really a gloabl event with three co-trainers were located in Canada, the USA, and a helper in Belgium. Everyone but Greg spoke Spanish to some degree. The students were encouraged to ask questions or make comments in either English or Spanish, so [the etherpad supported a really bilingual mix of stories and notes](https://twitter.com/raynamharris/status/1030829866562793472). On Day 1, Sue and I taught the lessons completely in English but responded with some Spnaish responses. On Day 2 after lunch, Alejandra translated the "introduction to introductions" episode and taught that in Spanish. It was great! I had her Spanish written text and her explanation, so I could talk in Spanish without mentally translating. This was easier than live-translating what Sue was teaching on day 1 with the English text and only my mental capacity and google translate. I was the lead instructor for last two episodes regarding The Carpentry [teaching practices](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/22-practices/index.html) and [operations](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/20-carpentries/index.html), so I live translated those on the fly and delivered those lessons in Spanish with occasional help from the audience. I've already prepared a few slides and talks about the Carpentries in Spanish, so some of this was from memory. The final was a 20 min roundtable discussion about what everyone was excited about moving forward.  It's nice to have a face-to-face discussion and hear each other's voices when you've spent 12 hours typing your own thoughts and reading other peoples thoughts. Everyone has the same goal of organizing better training programs for their local data-literate communities.

### Outlook

I think we've come a long way growing communities of people that are passionate about improving research and teaching all over the world. You can read more about the translation and lesson release in the Carpentries Blog [in Engligh](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/03/forlatinamerica.html) and [Spanish](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/03/paralatinoamerica.html).
As with the lesson translations, everyone is enthusiastic about orgainzeing more workshops and expanding the curricula. These will be a long-term community project. To get involved, checkout our [GitHub repository for Spnaish translations](https://github.com/Carpentries-ES/board) or joing the [Carpentries Latin America mailing list](email list for the Latin America group is https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/local-latinoamerica).

I've also come along way since this started. In 3 years my fluency in verbal and computing languages has grown. In 2015 I didn't think I was talented enough to teach programming in Spanish, but by early 2018 I had gained the experience and expertise necessary. It required some perseverance, but I didn't do it alone; many colleagues around the globe contributed support along to help turn some of these ideas into a reality. I think its a beutiful example of how having a growth mindset, grit, and community support is really important when we thinking about expanding the Carpentries into new communities. 

### Thanks
I want to thanks Paula Andrea Martinez and Maria Florencia for comments on earlier versions of this post. Thank to everyone who helped make all these events happen!
